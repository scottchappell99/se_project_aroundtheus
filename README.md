**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!

**Website**

**How it Works**

I've set up this page to have several points to adapt to the screen. Firstly, the cards will adapt as they run out of room. Secondly, the page as a whole adapts at 740px, because that's about when the profile buttons get near to touching. Thirdly, the copyright adapts at 879px and 580px because I want it to stay in line with the rest of the content.
